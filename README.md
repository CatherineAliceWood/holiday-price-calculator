A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/catherinewood/pen/ExGNxNv](https://codepen.io/catherinewood/pen/ExGNxNv).

My Javascript assignment for the CFG Degree.

### Notes:
- the brief was to have a very simple UI to allow for demonstration of various Javascript constructs
- a prototype web app which calculates the price of a holiday based on user input for a range of options or offers a wildcard if the user can't decide!
- some of the code is not very scalable, because it was written to demonstrate learning of various constructs rather than with a view to scalability, however, I refactored the code to getElementsByClassName and iterate over those elements with a for loop to remove the classes from the items which are not being selected, so some repetition was removed!
